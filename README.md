# Break Even

Inspired by my grandfather Donald J. Neville (1930-2019) who loved to play Blackjack and would always claim to **break even** ðŸ˜‰ even when he didn't. This is just a free online blackjack game I made for fun with Svelte and TypeScript to explore svelte animations and implement basic strategy hints. You can play using a mouse or WASD or arrow keys! Expand the advanced panels to see Don's hints based on basic strategy!
